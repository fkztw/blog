# ITSE == Introduction To Software Engineering  
## NCTUCS 2013-Fall Introduction to Software Engineering by Professor Feng-Jian Wang  
## Ch2 - Process Models  
  
---  
  
## Process Patterns  
  
+ A process pattern  
    + describes a process-related problem that is encountered during software engineering work  
    + identifies the environment in which the problem has been encountered  
    + suggests one or more proven solutions to the problem.  
+ A process pattern provides you with a template - **a consistent method for describing problem solutions within the context of the software process**.  
+ Patterns can be defined at any level of abstraction. In some cases, a pattern might be used to describe a problem (and solution) associated with a complete process model.  
+ patterns can be used to describe a problem (and solution) associated with a framework activity (e.g., planning) or an action within a framework activity (e.g., project estimating).  
+ Ambler [Amb98] has proposed a template for describing a process pattern:  
    + Pattern Name  
    + Forces - The environment in which the pattern is encountered and the issues that make the problem visible and may affect its solution.  
    + Type  
        + Stage pattern - defines a problem associated with **a framework activity for the process**.  
        + Task pattern -  defines a problem associated with **a software engineering action or work task and relevant to successful software engineering practice**.  
        + Phase pattern - define **the sequence of framework activities that occurs within the process, even when the overall flow of activities is iterative in nature**.  
    + Initial context - Describes the conditions under which the pattern applies.  
        1. What organizational or team-related activities have already occurred?  
        2. What is the entry state for the process?  
        3. What software engineering information or project information already exists?  
    + Problem - The specific problem to be solved by the pattern  
    + Solution - Describes how to implement the pattern successfully  
    + Resulting Context - Describes the conditions that will result once the pattern has been successfully implemented.  
    + Related Patterns - Provide a list of all process patterns that are directly related to this one.  
    + Known Uses and Examples - Indicate the specific instances in which the pattern is applicable.

## Prescriptive Process Models  
  
#### The Waterfall Model

#### Incremental Process Models

#### Evolutionary Process Models  
Evolutionary models are iterative.  
They are characterized in a manner that enables you to develop increasingly more complete versions of the software.
