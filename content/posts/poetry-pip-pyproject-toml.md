Summary: Things between Poetry, pip and pyproject.toml according to my own reviews.


# TL;DR

- Projects only have `pyproject.toml` (No `setup.py`)
    - Just use `pip >= 19.0`
- `pip >= 10.0` starts to support [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/)
- `pip >= 19.0` starts to support [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/)

# Why not `setup.py` anymore?

Accroding to the "Rationale" section of `PEP 518`:
> Using an executable file to specify build requirements under distutils isn't an issue as distutils is part of Python's standard library. Having the build tool as part of Python means that a setup.py has no external dependency that a project maintainer needs to worry about to build a distribution of their project. There was no need to specify any dependency information as the only dependency is Python.

> But when a project chooses to use setuptools, the use of an executable file like setup.py becomes an issue. You can't execute a setup.py file without knowing its dependencies, but currently there is no standard way to know what those dependencies are in an automated fashion without executing the setup.py file where that information is stored. It's a catch-22 of a file not being runnable without knowing its own contents which can't be known programmatically unless you run the file.

# Why `pyproject.toml`?

- Say goodbye to lots of `requirements.txt` files, you just need `pyproject.toml`
- Say goodbye to `setup.py`, you just need `pyproject.toml`
    - No need to write the dependencies in both `requirements.txt` and `setup.py`.
    - Or parsing the `requirements.txt` in `setup.py`.
- There are some tools start to read their config from `pyproject.toml`

# Poetry

## Pros

- It locks the dependency and generates `poetry.lock` file just like `pipenv`
- The reason why I use `poetry` instead of `pipenv`:
    - During my last job, we use `pipenv` at first.
    - One day, we encountered a strange bug which only showed on the production machine.
    - It turns out the problem is `pipenv` didn't lock the dependencies properly.
    - We confirmed the bug is made by `pipenv`.
    - We just give Poetry a try.
    - It fixed the problem.
- Other reasons why you should consider not using `pipenv` in 2020 can be found in this blog post: [Pipenv: promises a lot, delivers very little | Chris Warrick](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#a-2020-update-updated)
- Poetry is not the first package manager accepts `pyproject.toml`.
    - I use [`flit`](https://github.com/takluyver/flit) 1.0 back in Apirl, 2018, which supports `pyproject.toml`
    - And that's the time I know `pyproject.toml`
    - `flit` is still being developed and it's lastest version is 2.3.0 now.
    - But, Poetry has more features.

## Cons

This project is young and still developing. So, like other young projects, lots of things are WIP:

- During the time I wrote this blog post. It hasn't support the `platforms` in `setup.py`, [but it does have the `platforms` metadata in the code](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/845ae55c3c85714e4234c9ad46d3c8665f2592db/poetry/masonry/metadata.py#L12).
- Some documentations are not so clear, so you need to search GitHub issues and read lots of discussion to find the answer. And it might be changed in the future.
    - `[tool.poetry.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml` works like `scripts` in `setuptools`
        - while some people think it's a task runner.
    - `[tool.poetry.plugins]` in `pyproject.toml` works like `entry_point` in `setuptools`
        - and some people ask "Then why you use the word `plugin`?"
