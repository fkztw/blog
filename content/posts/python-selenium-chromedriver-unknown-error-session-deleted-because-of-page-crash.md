# Error Message

```text
selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: session deleted because of page crash
from unknown error: cannot determine loading status
from tab crashed
```

---

# TL;DR

Added these two arguments for Selenium ChromeOptions solved my problem.

```python
chrome_options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')
chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')
```

---

# Detail

- `--disable-dev-shm-usage`
    - > This will force Chrome to use the /tmp directory instead. This may slow down the execution though since disk will be used instead of memory.
- "from tab crashed"
    - > Relates to Linux attempting to always use /dev/shm for non-executable memory.
