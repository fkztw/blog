I am learning some bash shortcut keys in emacs mode in order to become a better sysytem administrator and just found that Alt+\* shortcut keys can't be used in my MacBook Air within iTerm2 and default Terminal.  
  
Here are solutions below.

### iTerm2  
  
According to this post [Bash keyboard shortcuts in iTerm like Alt+d and Alt+f ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18923765/bash-keyboard-shortcuts-in-iterm-like-altd-and-altf).  
  
1. `Command + O` to open the iTerm2 profiles  
2. Click Edit Profiles  
3. Choose left option key as `+Esc` or both left and right option key on the bottom right corner  
4. Close the iTerm2 Profiles  
  
It should works.
